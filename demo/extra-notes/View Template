There are other view templates other than thymeleaf
You only need to add their dependency inside pom.xml

You don't need to put dependency if you are using JSP because it is provided by Tomcat or Jetty

But Tomcat and Jetty containers usually look for JSP somewhere under /WEB-INF . 

JSP is an option only if you are building your application as WAR file and deploying it in a traditional servlet container

If you are building and executable JAR file , you must choose other templates like ThymeLeaf

___________________________________________________________________________

- Templates usually are cache only once

- You can disable caching during development by spring.thymeleaf.cache = false

- Devtools help us disable template caching but will disable itself when your application is deployed
